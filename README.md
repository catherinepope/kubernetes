# Kubernetes for Pontiffs

I'm working towards the Certified Kubernetes Administrator qualification. In this repo, I'll add my notes for accountability.

The main sources I'm using so far are:

* *Learn Kubernetes in a Month of Lunches* by Elton Stoneman
* Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) course on [A Cloud Guru]([url](https://learn.acloud.guru/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator/dashboard))
